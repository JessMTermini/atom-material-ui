A dynamic UI theme for Atom that (kinda) follows Google's Material Design Guidelines. Best with Atom's built-in Base16 Light or Dark Themes.

Inspired by Mattia Astorino's [SublimeText theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

It is a fork of a currently Archived Repository, located [here](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-ui). 

Right now there are plans in the works to continue development, but that hasn't started yet and so it is currently **not being supported**, but please do check back for future updates on this!


# Installation

<!---Fire up a console and type:

```shell
apm install atom-material-ui
```

Or, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this package. --->
Currently available inside Atom's settings, select Install and then search for this package.

# Configuration

Atom Material UI supports different accent colors. To change it, go to Settings > Themes and click the cog icon next to the theme selector.

You'll find the color picker there.

# Known Issues

### Custom Color Choices
  
There is an issue currently getting the chosen colors in settings to work when installing and trying to use it's sister product [Atom Material Syntax theme](https://github.com/JessMTermini/atom-material-syntax), and also when choosing to use Atom's "One Light" and "One Dark" Themes.

As a current quick work-around, to get your chosen color options to work simply choose between any of the other built-in theme choices in Atom (Now Pulsar). So far we have tested "Atom Light", "Atom Dark", "Base16 Tomorrow Light", "Base16 Tomorrow Dark, and "Solarized Light" and "Solarized Dark", all to work!!

If you are having issues getting your color choices to work, after setting them, change themes back to and then from one of the above themes a few times and this should get it to work. 

### Custom Font Size Changes

Changing the font from within the theme editor seems to make the whole editor go into buzurk mode. Currently it is NOT recommended. We are currently looking into this issue. 

### Internal Themes - Settings Resets

Some of the themes internal settings such as the width and height of the tabs if you have set them seem to reset upon custom color changes. Luckily this is a simple fix, just re-add the checkmark to implement full-width tabs again and you should be good to go.

Other than that, it really is a beautiful theme. And i still choose to use it, even in this state as it doen't seem to cause any errors major or otherwise anywheere else in the editor, so I am very pleased with it. Many thanks to this themes original creator!
